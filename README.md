## Usage

### Adding a Rule
1. Click the extension icon in your toolbar
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Group name**: A friendly name for the group (e.g., "Work", "Social Media")
   - **Pattern**: URL pattern with wildcards (e.g., `*.github.com/*`, `*google.com*`)
   - **Color**: Choose a color for the tab group
3. Click "Add Rule"

### Pattern Examples
- `*.github.com/*` - Matches all GitHub pages
- `*reddit.com*` - Matches Reddit and any subdomain

## How It Works

When you navigate to a new URL or update a tab:
- The extension checks if the URL matches any of your configured patterns
- If it matches, the tab is added to the corresponding group (creating the group if needed)
- If it doesn't match any pattern and the tab is in a group, it's ungrouped
